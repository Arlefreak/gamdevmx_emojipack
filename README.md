# Mexican Game Dev Emoji PAck

Downloads a team's Slack emojis and formats them as a YAML file, for use with emojipacks.

When used in conjunction with [emojipacks](https://github.com/lambtron/emojipacks), this tool allows for downloading and re-uploading emojis across multiple slack teams. Ideal if you have multiple teams that want to share emojis, such as different friend groups, school groups, or others!

This project requires node 6 (or higher) and yarn as dependencies.

## Setup

1. Install `emojipacks` with `yarn install -g emojipacks` (npm works as well)

2. Run `emojipacks` in your terminal, and follow the instructions.

3. Once `emojipacks` has run, you should have access to your old emojis in your new team! Yay!
